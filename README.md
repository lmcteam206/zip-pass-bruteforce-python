- use main.py to brute force a zip file
- out folder is the out put folder
- k.zip is an example .zip file that it's paaword is '12345'

how it works:
when you give the .zip file diroctry to the tool it will try diffrent passwords that it generates until it found the correct password
then it extract it in the out folder

note:
please be panic because brute force took a certien time depends on the computer power and the password difficulty
